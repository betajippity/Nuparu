/**
 * This function is used to read data into the specified dynamic buffer
 * sequence until the dynamic buffer sequence's get area contains the specified
 * delimiter. The call will block until one of the following conditions is
 * true:
 *
 * @li The get area of the dynamic buffer sequence contains the specified
 * delimiter.
 *
 * @li An error occurred.
 *
 * This operation is implemented in terms of zero or more calls to the stream's
 * read_some function. If the dynamic buffer sequence's get area already
 * contains the delimiter, the function returns immediately.
 *
 * @param s The stream from which the data is to be read. The type must support
 * the SyncReadStream concept.
 *
 * @param buffers The dynamic buffer sequence into which the data will be read.
 *
 * @param delim The delimiter character.
 *
 * @returns The number of bytes in the dynamic buffer sequence's get area up to
 * and including the delimiter.
 *
 * @throws boost::system::system_error Thrown on failure.
 *
 * @note After a successful read_until operation, the dynamic buffer sequence
 * may contain additional data beyond the delimiter. An application will
 * typically leave that data in the dynamic buffer sequence for a subsequent
 * read_until operation to examine.
 *
 * @par Example
 * To read data into a @c std::string until a newline is encountered:
 * @code std::string data;
 * std::size_t n = boost::asio::read_until(s,
 *     boost::asio::dynamic_buffer(data), '\n');
 * std::string line = data.substr(0, n);

 * After the @c read_until operation completes successfully, the string @c data
 * contains the delimiter:
 * @code { 'a', 'b', ..., 'c', '\n', 'd', 'e', ... } @endcode
 * The call to @c substr then extracts the data up to and including the
 * delimiter, so that the string @c line contains:
 * @code { 'a', 'b', ..., 'c', '\n' } @endcode
 * After the call to @c erase, the remaining data is left in the buffer @c b as

/// Start an asynchronous operation to read data into a dynamic buffer sequence

/**
 * This function is used to asynchronously read data into the specified dynamic
 * buffer sequence until a user-defined match condition function object, when
 * applied to the data contained in the dynamic buffer sequence, indicates a
 * successful match. It is an initiating function for an @ref
 * asynchronous_operation, and always returns immediately. The asynchronous
 * operation will continue until one of the following conditions is true:
 *
 * @li The match condition function object returns a std::pair where the second
 * element evaluates to true.
 *
 * @li An error occurred.
 *
 * This operation is implemented in terms of zero or more calls to the stream's
 * async_read_some function, and is known as a <em>composed operation</em>. If
 * the match condition function object already indicates a match, this
 * asynchronous operation completes immediately. The program must ensure that
 * the stream performs no other read operations (such as async_read,
 * async_read_until, the stream's async_read_some function, or any other
 * composed operations that perform reads) until this operation completes.
 *
 * @param s The stream from which the data is to be read. The type must support
 * the AsyncReadStream concept.
 *
 * @param buffers The dynamic buffer sequence into which the data will be read.
 * Although the buffers object may be copied as necessary, ownership of the
 * underlying memory blocks is retained by the caller, which must guarantee
 * that they remain valid until the completion handler is called.
 *
 * @param match_condition The function object to be called to determine whether
 * a match exists. The signature of the function object must be:
 * @code pair<iterator, bool> match_condition(iterator begin, iterator end);
 * @endcode
 * where @c iterator represents the type:
 * @code buffers_iterator<typename DynamicBuffer_v1::const_buffers_type>
 * @endcode
 * The iterator parameters @c begin and @c end define the range of bytes to be
 * scanned to determine whether there is a match. The @c first member of the
 * return value is an iterator marking one-past-the-end of the bytes that have
 * been consumed by the match function. This iterator is used to calculate the
 * @c begin parameter for any subsequent invocation of the match condition. The
 * @c second member of the return value is true if a match has been found, false
 * otherwise.
 *
 * @param token The @ref completion_token that will be used to produce a
 * completion handler, which will be called when the read completes.
 * Potential completion tokens include @ref use_future, @ref use_awaitable,
 * @ref yield_context, or a function object with the correct completion
 * signature. The function signature of the completion handler must be:
 * @code void handler(
 *   // Result of operation.
 *   const boost::system::error_code& error,
 *
 *   // The number of bytes in the dynamic buffer sequence's
 *   // get area that have been fully consumed by the match
 *   // function. O if an error occurred.
 *   std::size_t bytes_transferred
 * ); @endcode
 * Regardless of whether the asynchronous operation completes immediately or
 * not, the completion handler will not be invoked from within this function.
 * On immediate completion, invocation of the handler will be performed in a
 * manner equivalent to using boost::asio::async_immediate().
 *
 * @note After a successful async_read_until operation, the dynamic buffer
 * sequence may contain additional data beyond that which matched the function
 * object. An application will typically leave that data in the dynamic buffer
 * sequence for a subsequent async_read_until operation to examine.
 *
 * @par Completion Signature
 * @code void(boost::system::error_code, std::size_t) @endcode
 *
 * @note The default implementation of the @c is_match_condition type trait
 * evaluates to true for function pointers and function objects with a
 * @c result_type typedef. It must be specialised for other user-defined
 * function objects.
 *

 *     boost::asio::const_buffer> iterator;

 * ...
 * void handler(const boost::system::error_code& e, std::size_t size);
 * ...
 * std::string data;
 * boost::asio::async_read_until(s, data, match_whitespace, handler);
 * @endcode

/**
 * This function is used to asynchronously read data into the specified dynamic

 * asynchronous_operation, and always returns immediately. The asynchronous
 * operation will continue until one of the following conditions is true:
 *
 * @li The get area of the dynamic buffer sequence contains the specified
 * delimiter.
 *
 * @li An error occurred.
 *
 * This operation is implemented in terms of zero or more calls to the stream's
 * async_read_some function, and is known as a <em>composed operation</em>. If
 * the dynamic buffer sequence's get area already contains the delimiter, this
 * asynchronous operation completes immediately. The program must ensure that
 * the stream performs no other read operations (such as async_read,
 * async_read_until, the stream's async_read_some function, or any other
 * composed operations that perform reads) until this operation completes.
 *
 * @param s The stream from which the data is to be read. The type must support
 * the AsyncReadStream concept.
 *
 * @param buffers The dynamic buffer sequence into which the data will be read.
 * Although the buffers object may be copied as necessary, ownership of the
 * underlying memory blocks is retained by the caller, which must guarantee
 * that they remain valid until the completion handler is called.
 *
 * @param delim The delimiter character.
 *
 * @param token The @ref completion_token that will be used to produce a
 * completion handler, which will be called when the read completes.
 * Potential completion tokens include @ref use_future, @ref use_awaitable,

 *   // get area up to and including the delimiter.
 *   // 0 if an error occurred.
 *   std::size_t bytes_transferred
 * ); @endcode
 * Regardless of whether the asynchronous operation completes immediately or
 * not, the completion handler will not be invoked from within this function.

 * manner equivalent to using boost::asio::async_immediate().
 *
 * @par Completion Signature
 * @code void(boost::system::error_code, std::size_t) @endcode

 * @note After a successful async_read_until operation, the dynamic buffer
