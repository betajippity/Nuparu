/// Start an asynchronous operation to read a certain amount of data at the

/**
 * This function is used to asynchronously read a certain number of bytes of
 * data from a random access device at the specified offset. It is an
 * initiating function for an @ref asynchronous_operation, and always returns
 * immediately. The asynchronous operation will continue until one of the
 * following conditions is true:
 *
 * @li The completion_condition function object returns 0.
 *
 * This operation is implemented in terms of zero or more calls to the device's
 * async_read_some_at function.
 *
 * @param d The device from which the data is to be read. The type must support
 * the AsyncRandomAccessReadDevice concept.
 *
 * @param offset The offset at which the data will be read.
 *
 * @param b A basic_streambuf object into which the data will be read. Ownership
 * of the streambuf is retained by the caller, which must guarantee that it
 * remains valid until the completion handler is called.
 *
 * @param completion_condition The function object to be called to determine
 * whether the read operation is complete. The signature of the function object
 * must be:
 * @code std::size_t completion_condition(
 *   // Result of latest async_read_some_at operation.
 *   const boost::system::error_code& error,
 *
 *   // Number of bytes transferred so far.
 *   std::size_t bytes_transferred
 * ); @endcode
 * A return value of 0 indicates that the read operation is complete. A non-zero
 * return value indicates the maximum number of bytes to be read on the next
 * call to the device's async_read_some_at function.
 *
 * @param token The @ref completion_token that will be used to produce a
 * completion handler, which will be called when the read completes.
 * Potential completion tokens include @ref use_future, @ref use_awaitable,
 * @ref yield_context, or a function object with the correct completion
 * signature. The function signature of the completion handler must be:
 * @code void handler(
 *   // Result of operation.
 *   const boost::system::error_code& error,
 *
 *   // Number of bytes copied into the buffers. If an error
 *   // occurred, this will be the number of bytes successfully
 *   // transferred prior to the error.
 *   std::size_t bytes_transferred
 * ); @endcode
 * Regardless of whether the asynchronous operation completes immediately or
 * not, the completion handler will not be invoked from within this function.
 * On immediate completion, invocation of the handler will be performed in a
 * manner equivalent to using boost::asio::async_immediate().
 *
 * @par Completion Signature
 * @code void(boost::system::error_code, std::size_t) @endcode
